# Restaurant-Revenue-Prediction
In this project, I'm going to work on the "Restaurant revenue" dataset which contains 100 observations of restaurants with 8 attributes.


Creating a machine learning model to predict the revenue of the restaurant based on
the features present in the dataset.


Dataset Attributes:
1. ID - Restaurant ID
2. Name - Name of the Restaurant
3. Franchise - Restaurant has franchise or not
4. Category - specific type of category provided by restaurant
5. No_of_item - Different types of items provided by restaurant
6. Order_Placed - Order placed by customer to restaurant (in lacs)
7. Revenue - Total amount of income generated by the restaurant
